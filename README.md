# Simple Daily Planner
For the 5th Module in the course we had to create a simple daily planner 
using Date.JS

Using Date.JS is very simple and easy only taking only about 15 minutes to 
code the functionaility with most the time spent on the UI.

For UI I decided to try something new, I prefer simple modern and over simplified UI/UX's 
but for this assignement I went all the way back to 2007 - 2012 and used Skeuomorph for the UI.

Realisticly texture elements worked well with this project since traidtionally daily planning
was done on paper not your computer
